# ComposePractice
This project is created to practice with different Jetpack Compose elements.
Any idea that pops in my head or I find on Pinterest I can recreate here as a sandbox.
This is solely focused on UI, so no viewmodels and data retrieving.

# Projects
Every 'project' will get its own folder inside `com.example.composepractice.ui.project`.
